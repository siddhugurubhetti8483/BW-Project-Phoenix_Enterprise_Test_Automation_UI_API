## Overview

This project contains performance test plans created using Apache JMeter (or optionally k6).
The tests target the Employee List page of OrangeHRM to measure performance under varying load.

You can run the .jmx files included here to execute load tests, collect metrics, and generate reports.

### Performance Test Plan

Objective:
Measure response time degradation when 25 / 50 / 100 virtual users (VUs) load the Employee List page.

Tool: Apache JMeter (preferred) or k6.

Scenario:

Login (reuse cookie if possible) → Navigate to PIM → Employee List → Measure page load (first byte to DOM ready where possible).

Load pattern:

Ramp-up: 2 minutes

Steady load: 5 minutes per level

Ramp-down: 1 minute

Runs repeated for 25, 50, and 100 VUs

Metrics Collected:

Average response time

95th & 99th percentile latency

Peak response time

Throughput (requests/sec)

Error rate

Number of timeouts

Success Criteria:

Average < 2.5s

p95 < 4s (at 50 VUs)

Error rate < 1%

Reporting:

Graphs for each load level

Comparative table across load levels

Highlight bottlenecks if p95 increases significantly

### Prerequisites

Java (JDK) → Required to run JMeter (Java 8+).

Apache JMeter → GUI & CLI (recommended: JMeter 5.0+).

Browser → To open HTML dashboards generated by JMeter.

### Project Structure
