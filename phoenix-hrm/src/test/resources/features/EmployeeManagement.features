Feature: Edit existing employee personal details
  As an HR Admin
  I want to edit an existing employee's personal details
  So that records stay up to date

  Scenario: Update middle name for an employee
    Given I am logged in as admin
    And I am on the PIM Employee List page
    When I search employee by id "<EMP_ID>"
    And I open the employee details
    And I update middle name to "Prakash"
    Then I should see middle name as "Prakash"
